		<h1>About Ben Wong</h1>
		<h2>Technology</h2>
		I found my passion in the beauty of design, engineering and entrepreneurship in coding and completed the coding bootcamp, <a href="http://www.codingdojo.com/">Coding Dojo</a>, based in San Francisco in October 2015. 

		In the program, I learned the basics in web development (HTML, CSS, jQuery, and MySQL), the LAMP stack (PHP & CodeIgniter), the MEAN stack (Javascript & Angular), and Rails. My favourite stack is Rails (Ruby on Rails). I have built replicas of prominent websites in the following: 
		
			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://github.com/bwong199/treebook">Facebook</a> - the world's largest social media site</li>
				<li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://github.com/bwong199/TwitterClone">Twitter</a> - A micro-blogging social network site</li>
				<li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://github.com/bwong199/RedditClone">Reddit</a> - a news discussion site</li>
				<li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://github.com/bwong199/Wikipediaclone">Wikipedia</a> - a crowdsourced encyclopedia</li>
				<li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://github.com/bwong199/PinterestClone">Pinterest</a> - an image collection site</li>
				<li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://github.com/bwong199/imdbClone">IMDb</a> - a movie site </li>
			</ul>

		Please visit my <a href="https://github.com/bwong199">Github</a> to see my codes and let me know how I can improve as a programmer.

		I taught myself Java OOP to pass the assessment for the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801">Udacity Android Development Nanodegree</a> program in December 2015 and started the program in January 2016. 

		I have since built Android apps in the following: 

			<ul class="list-group">
				<li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://github.com/bwong199/AndroidInstagramClone">Instagram</a> - a photo sharing app</li>
				<li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://github.com/bwong199/AndroidTwitter">Twitter</a> - a micro-blogging app</li>
				<li class="list-group-item"><a href="https://github.com/bwong199/AndroidUber">Uber</a> - a ride sharing app that matches riders and drivers based on geolocation</li>
			</ul>




		<strong><h2>Finance </h2></strong>
		I worked as an accounting and finance professional with equity research experience in the Canadian and International energy sector. I graduated from the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) with a degree in accounting, and have completed all the exams for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartered_Financial_Analyst">CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst)</a>, <a href="https://www.cpacanada.ca/">CGA-CPA (Certified General Accountants-Chartered Professional Accountants)</a>, and <a href="http://www.fpsc.ca/">CFP (Certified Financial Planner)</a> programs.

I like stocks and investing and follow the market closely. Sectors I follow include upstream/midstream/downstream energy, retail, real estate, banking & insurance, utilities, telecommunications and technology. I abscribe to Benjamin Graham's style of value investing and Nassim Nicholas Taleb's style of Black-Swan event investing.

<strong><h2>Hobbies</h2></strong>
When my attention is away from business, finance and technology, I enjoy keeping up with my four languages (French, Mandarin, Cantonese, English) using the Duolingo app and watching foreign films. 
<br>
<br>
I also teach coding on Saturday in a program called <a href="http://calgarylibrary.ca/coder-dojo/">Coder Dojo</a> to a group of 15 children between the ages of 9 - 17 in the Calgary Public Library. Things I teach include web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and Ruby), Java programming and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Coder Dojo</a>Scratch.</a>
<br>
<br>
I trained with a retired fitness model and trained myself to a <a href="https://scontent-sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/1656397_10150581540339981_7387369704527447316_n.jpg?oh=ea9974036c80e3d66b589913c9076490&oe=57321BD5">competition level</a> as defined by body-fat percentage, adonis ratio (shoulders-to-waist ratio), and fat-free-mass-index (an index that improves on the popular BMI to account for muscle mass). I freelance as a physique trainer and help my clients realize their fitness goals.
